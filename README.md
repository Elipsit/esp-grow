# esp-grow
This project contains the Altium Designer schematic and pcb files, wiring diacrams and code for an esp8266 based indoor plant monitoring system.

This system is comprised of three main blocks:
1) Wemos D1 - ESP-12F; I really like working with this form factor since it has an esp8266 with a breadboard header and a CH340G
2) ESP-Grow_OLED_Rev_A: custom 2 layer pcb with a generic SSD1306 128x64 I2C monochrome OLED screen and a tack button seated under the screen.      Basically a screen button.
3) ESP-Grow_OLED_Main_A: The motherboard. A custom 4 Layer pcb with all the connectors, power rails and leds.

Current Progress: 5/4/2019
Designing a revision A that will have all the connections made with Molex Micro-Fit connectons
